# 1. Write a Python program to find the number of times 4 appears in the tuple. 

# Input: tuplex = (2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7 )

#  Output: 3 


# Define the input tuple
tuplex = (2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7)

# Use the count() method to find occurrences of 4
count_4 = tuplex.count(4)

# Print the result
print("Output:", count_4)

# Output: 3
